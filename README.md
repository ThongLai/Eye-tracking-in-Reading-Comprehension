# Eye-tracking-in-Reading-Comprehension
Deriving valuable insights from the dataset by categorizing fixations into "First Pass" (initial read) or "Second Pass" (subsequent read) sequences.

Developing an Anomaly Detection mechanism for the dataset where using the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) to identify and remove outliers, as well as establishing criteria for accurately determining when a reader transitioned to the next line of text. These contributions notably improved the robustness and accuracy of the data analysis process.

The project required meticulous work to understand readers' eye movements and reading patterns. The dataset encompassed approximately 20 features, tracking various aspects of readers' eye movements, including fixation coordinates, durations, and directions.
